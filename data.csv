Are you familiar with XR technologies (AR, VR, MR)? 

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view. Examples of augmented reality systems range from Pokemon Go on mobile devices to Minecraft on HoloLens.
Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that gives users an immersive feel of a virtual world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment (particularly video games), education (such as medical or military training) and business (such as virtual meetings). 
Mixed reality (MR) is a term used to describe the merging of a real-world environment and a computer-generated one. Physical and virtual objects may co-exist in mixed reality environments and interact in real time.",2.	How often do you use XR systems?,3.	Which platform do you mostly use for XR systems?
